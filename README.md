- **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Works with GitHub Pages deployment
- **Deep Linking**: Direct access to specific todo lists via URLs

## How Shareable Links Work

When you create a todo list with "Generate shareable link" enabled:

1. **Link Generation**: The app creates a unique URL like `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/#/shared/uuid`
2. **Share the Link**: Send this link to anyone you want to share the todo list with
3. **Access**: When someone opens the link, they'll see the todo list in read-only mode
4. **Updates**: The shared view reflects the current state of your todo list

### Example Sharing Workflow
1. Create a project todo list for your team
2. Enable "Generate shareable link" when creating
3. Share the generated link with team members
4. Team members can view progress without needing the app installed
5. Updates you make are visible to everyone with the link

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Web Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. **Build for Web**:
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Copy the contents of `build/web/` to your repository
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Set source to main branch

3. **Update Base URL**: In `lib/services/todo_service.dart`, update the `_generateShareableLink` method with your actual GitHub Pages URL:
   ```dart
   String _generateShareableLink(String listId) {
     return 'https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/#/shared/$listId';
   }
   ```

4. **Enable Web Features**: The app includes web-specific deep linking functionality for shareable links.
